My Name is Adrian Au, I'm a senior analyst at CIBCMellon as well as a real estate investor.
My career goal is to learn as much as I can in the FinTech's sphere and then create my own company to improve efficiency in areas that's lacking
I'm currently in finance and interested in coding, that's why I thought it would be interesting to take a fintech coding course.
